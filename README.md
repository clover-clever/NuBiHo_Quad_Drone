2025, first semester Microprocessor Quad Drone Project

Based on Arduino Uno R3 for control with PPM Signal

PPM for SPRacing R3

Self-made PCBs
  - 6V Regulator does not work well,(Burnt)(delete 6V Switching Regulator and use it)
  - LM1117 - 12V --> 5V(too big voltage difference, do not use for high load, or just do not use it)
